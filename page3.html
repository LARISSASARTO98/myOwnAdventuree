		<h1> Places you should go when visiting London! </h1>
		<hr/>
		<h2> 1. Big Ben and Parliament </h2>
		<p> • Nothing screams "London" more emphatically than the tower housing the giant clock and its resounding bell known as Big Ben. It's as iconic a landmark!! Below it, stretching along the Thames, are the Houses of Parliament, seat of Britain's government for many centuries and once the site of the royal Westminster Palace occupied by William the Conqueror.Tours of the parliament buildings offer a unique chance to see real-time debates and lively political discussions. </p>

		<H2> 2. The Londond eye </H2>
		<p> • Built to mark London's millennium celebrations in 2000, the London Eye is Europe's largest observation wheel. Its individual glass capsules offer the most spectacular views of the city as you embark. The journey lasts close to 30 minutes, often quicker than the time spent lining up for your turn. If you can, reserve your time in advance. </p>
