		<h2> 5. Buckingham Palace </h2>
		<p> • Buckingham Palace has been the official residence (and also where the offices are located) of the British monarchy, in London, since 1837. The building has no less than 775 rooms and, in addition to serving as a base for the monarch and his family, there several royal ceremonies and state visits are also held. As one of the most visited spots in the English capital, the palace area is always full of tourists (on Sundays and national holidays, local traffic is only allowed for pedestrians). 

		• Between May and July, there is a daily changing of the guard in front of the palace. The ceremony starts at 11:30 am and the tip for those who want to see everything up close is to arrive early. During the summer, when Queen Elizabeth II spends the season in Scotland, it is possible to visit some facilities on the site, such as the state rooms and the royal stable.
